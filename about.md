I am a jack of all trades looking for freelance, contract and permanent work in the field of web development. I am versed in Ruby on Rails, jQuery, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS. I most often use Bootstrap because I'm well versed in it and find designing for mobile-first, and making sites responsive to be easier for that.

Besides all things tech, I have intellectual interests in Economics, Government, Social Policy.

When I'm not working I enjoy composing music, cooking a good meal and generally spending time with loved ones.
