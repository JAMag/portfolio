I am a full stack web developer available for freelance, contract and permanent web development work. I am versed in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, HAML, SQL, NoSQL. I am familiar with custom WordPress themes, and version-control
                                                                                                                                                                                                      through GitHub and BitBucket. I've used Heroku, AWS, APIs, and TDD. I most often use Bootstrap because I find building mobile-first, responsive-designed sites well suited for it. And when I am not using pen and paper, I use Balsamiq for wireframing.

Besides all things tech, I have interests in Economics, Government, Music, and the Patriots.


I have spent the last few years learning web development through self-study, a full-stack web
development boot-camp, and a private tutor. I'm hoping to pick up React in the second half of 2018. I have worked from mockups and follow responsive design
best practices. I have some experience with pair
programming. I have experience incorporating outside APIs including Stripe, Braintree, Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, and Lockitron. Although you will find
many projects in my Github repo, my most complete project to date is titled Bloc-Acres. I direct you to
that repository to understand my knowledge and skills. There is a video tour of it here, and a landing page for it is at
www.moverable.com. It is a work in progress, and I am continuing to learn every day and remembering to push to Git and Heroku often.
