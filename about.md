I am a full stack web developer available for freelance, contract and permanent web development work. I am versed in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, HAML, SQL, NoSQL. I am familiar with custom WordPress themes, and version-control through GitHub and BitBucket. Iâ€™ve used Heroku, AWS, APIs, and TDD. I use Bootstrap because I find it well suited for mobile-first, responsive-design. When I am not using pen and paper, I use Balsamiq for wireframing.

I have experience incorporating outside APIs including Stripe, Braintree, Facebook, Twitter, Google Maps, and Lockitron. Although you will find many projects in my Github repo, Bloc-Acres is my most complete project to date. I direct you to that repository to understand my knowledge and skills. There is a video tour of it on this site, and a landing page for it is at www.moverable.com.

Learning web development can be a difficult process, though quashing bugs and building new features is worth it. Nonetheless, I am continuing to learn every day and enjoying it while I do so!
