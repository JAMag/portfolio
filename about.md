I am a jack of all trades looking for freelance, contract and permanent work in the field of web development. I am versed in Ruby on Rails, jQuery, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, HAML. I've used heroku, aws, api's, google maps and TDD. I most often use Bootstrap because I find designing mobile-first, responsive sites well suited for it.

Besides all things tech, I have intellectual interests in Economics, Government, Social Policy.

Outside of work I enjoy composing music, cooking a good meal, hiking with my pup, day-tripping in the roadster, and spending time with loved ones.



 I am a career switcher. So I bring passion, and the humility required of one who decides to switch roads
mid-journey. I have excellent communication skills and an easy-going nature that helps me enjoy both
independent and collaborative work. I am still learning and expect to learn new things every day.

I have spent the last two years learning web development through self-study, a full-stack web
development boot-camp, and a private tutor. I am proficient in Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS and
have knowledge of PHP and JavaScript. I have worked off of mockups and follow responsive design
best practices. I am familiar with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL. I have some experience with pair
programming, jQuery and Ajax. I am familiar with the CMS system Wordpress, and version-control
through Git. I have experience incorporating outside APIs including Stripe and Lockitron. Although you will find
many projects in my Github repo, my most complete project to date is titled Bloc-Acres. I direct you to
that repository to understand my knowledge and skills. Alternatively, you can view it live at
www.moverable.com (requires user account, but contains video tour). It is a work in progress, and I am
pushing to Git and Heroku often.
