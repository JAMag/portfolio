title: Learning Journey

During the past two years, I have used many different resources to learn web development. I have read books like: Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails, Marijn Haverbeke's Eloquent Javascript, and an Idiot's Guide to SQL.

I have used online video tutorial sites like: CodePlace.com, Treehouse.com, Linda.com, CodeSchool.com, RailsCasts.com, and various Youtube tutorials.


I have used more static tutorial sites like: sitepoint.com, theodinproject.com, freecodecamp.com.

I have gone through the bloc.io online bootcamp full-stack web development course.

And I have used a tutor for months on end. The tutoring time could be as brief as 30minutes a week and as long as two hours per week.
