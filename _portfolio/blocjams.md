Summary:
Moverable is the main piece of my portfolio. I designed, and developed it. It is a For Sale By Owner real estate website that uses electronic locks, and scheduling to allow users to view a house when noone is home.
Explanation:
I concieved of Moverable long before I started in web development. It seemed silly that the internet hadn't disrupted the real estate field.
Problem:
The problem with disrupting the real estate market is that although much of the industry is simply information based, and therefore easily solveable by websites and apps, Real Estate agents also serve a gatekeeping and security function. However, those functions come at an extreme price and are now redundant due to the internet of things: electronic locks, sensors, cameras and smart phones.
Solution:
To replace the gatekeeping function of real estate agents, Moverable uses electronic locks, small fees, and smart-phone cameras to show houses when neither an owner or agent is present. This could mean potentially removing 5-7% off the purchase price of a house -- which is tens of thousands of dollars.
Results:
My first use of an outside API is with Lockitron's electronic locks. This was a simpler process than I thought it would be. My next issue was how to get photographic evidence that the person entering the home is who is signed up for the site. This is solved through the use of camera phones, payments and geolocation of that phone.
Conclusion:
The site is currently live, for portfolio purposes. But it is still a work in progress. Creating value for buyers is now the main question the site and business has to solve.
