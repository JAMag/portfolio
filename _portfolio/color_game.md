Simple game to help hone my JavaScript and a user's RGB skills. Upon screen load, a random color is picked as a target, and six circles with colors are drawn (with one of those circles in the color of the target). The user wins by picking the circle with the color that matches the RGB code in the heading. Created with vanilla JavaScript, html and css.
