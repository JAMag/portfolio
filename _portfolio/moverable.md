<strong>Summary:</strong>

Moverable is the main piece of my portfolio. It is a For Sale By Owner real estate website that uses electronic locks and scheduling to allow buyers to view a listed house on their own -- when nobody else is there.

<strong>Explanation:</strong>

I conceived, designed and implemented Moverable. Implementation was with a tutor’s guidance. It is a real estate listing site, which allows creation of users, listings, comments, appointments, and favorites. It allows for purchases using Stripe. It is fully responsive through Bootstrap, and so uses your computer or phone camera depending on how the user accesses the site. I implemented search using ThinkingSphinx, and I’m now building a map-based search by incorporating the Google Maps API. ActionMailer with SendGrid is used for email notifications, while the Twilio API is used for text (sms) based notifications. Geolocation is implemented using Geocoder. Images are currently stored on Amazon AWS.

I conceived of Moverable long before I started in web development. It seemed odd that the internet hadn’t yet disrupted the field of real estate. The problem with disrupting the real estate market is that agents serve gate-keeping, security, and recommendation functions. However, those functions come expensively and may now be made redundant because of the affordably-priced internet-of-things: electronic locks, sensors, cameras and smart phones are no longer science fiction. To replace the gatekeeping function of real estate agents, Moverable uses electronic locks, small purchases, and smart-phone cameras to show houses when no one but the potential buyer is present. This approach could mean potentially removing 5-7% off the purchase price of a house – which may be tens of thousands of dollars.

My first use of an outside API is with Lockitron’s electronic locks. It was a simpler process than I thought it would be. My next issue was how to get photographic evidence that the person entering the home is who they say they are. This is solved by requiring a "selfie" from a smartphone's camera, along with geolocation of that phone, and a fee per showing. The site is currently live, for portfolio purposes. But it is still a work in progress. Creating value for buyers is now the main question the site and business has to solve.
