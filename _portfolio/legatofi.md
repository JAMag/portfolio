Spotify clone. In this project you can use the site to listen to music. In it you can browse individual tracks and albums or create, update and delete personal playlists. It has a fully functional music player with: Next, Back, Play, Pause, Shuffle, and Volume controls. Furthermore, you may rewind or fastforward using each tracks progress bar. For future expansions with it, it would be interesting to see if I could implement a dee-jay like mixer, with looping, beat matching and crossfading -- and a record-spinning UX.
Here I used: PHP, Javascript, and MySqli for the primary functionality of the site. This required more AJAX, JSON, and MySqli queries than I've used before. This was also the first time I've investigated something else besides font-awesome for icons, instead, opting for Icon8.
